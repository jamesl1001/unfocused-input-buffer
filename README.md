# unfocused-input-buffer

Ever typed a really long message only to realise the input field wasn't selected? Annoying isn't it? ðŸ˜¡

Why not buffer that bad boy and have it magically appear when the user focuses the field? âœ¨

What a pleasing user experience they will have! ðŸ¤©

## Installation

```bash
yarn add unfocused-input-buffer
```

or

```bash
npm i unfocused-input-buffer --save
```

## Usage

Add a class or data attribute to all the input fields you want to be buffered. The default is the `data-buffered` attribute.
